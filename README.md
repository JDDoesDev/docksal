Docker powered environments for web development on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

Running Drupal, Wordpress, Magento, Laravel, Symfony, Backdrop, Grav, Hugo, Gatsby,
and others can be one step away with ready-to-use boilerplates.

```
fin project create
```

Create your [custom automation](https://docs.docksal.io/fin/custom-commands/) in Bash, PHP or Node
to spin up your project anywhere where Docksal is with a single command, or to automate regular tasks. A unified
environment ensures that your automation will work for everyone in your team.

## Better than VMs

"I love my Vagrant box. Why would I want to switch to a Docker based solution?"  

Containers are just [Better than VMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jev2EW2hzdY): 
smaller, faster, portable, and more efficient across the board.

Unified development environment for your team regardless of the OS.

Unprecedented ability to automate routine tasks, slashing the time to on-board new team members.
